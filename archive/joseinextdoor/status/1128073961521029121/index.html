  	      @ActionZacku Even the pulpiest of melodramas need to follow an internal character logic that the audience can track. Anime is full of buck-wild plot twists and power-ups, but the effective ones work because they’re driven by their characters’ emotional journeys.

  	      @ActionZacku Which is fine! There’s more than one way to interpret a show. I’m genuinely glad you had fun last night. But it comes across as very ivory-tower critic to act like ur the only one who "gets it" &amp; everyone who sincerely engaged &amp; is now sincerely disappointed are entitled idiots.
